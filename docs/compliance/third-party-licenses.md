only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
·       
work around any technical
limitations in the software;

reverse engineer, decompile or
disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for
the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms
governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the
software;
·       
remove, minimize, block or modify
any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software; 
·       
use the software in any way that

support services for it.
8.   
Entire
Agreement. This
agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and
support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and
support services.
9.    Applicable Law.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law
applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the
laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the
software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn
off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform
substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
(ii)       Limitation of Liability. In case of
intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability
Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is
liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only
be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material
contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
12.
Limitation
on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU
CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S.
$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It
also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the
laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the
software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn
off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform
substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is
liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only
be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material
contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It
also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility

may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting

Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED

$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

reverse engineer, decompile or
disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for
the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms
governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the
software;
·       
remove, minimize, block or modify
any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software; 
·       
use the software in any way that

Restrictions. You must comply with all domestic and international
export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information
on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
7.

SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide
support services for it.
8.   
Entire
Agreement. This
agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and
support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and
support services.
9.    Applicable Law.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law
applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the
laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the
software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn
off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform
substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is
liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only
be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material
contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It
also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in
the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
3.   
ADDITIONAL LICENSING

·       
You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
·       
Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications

·       
use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a way
that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or
·       
modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An “Excluded
License” is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or
distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source code
form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it.
4.

Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use
these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing
appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft’s
privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data
collection and its use from the software documentation and our privacy

software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn
off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform
substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
(ii)       Limitation of Liability. In case of
intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability
Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is
liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only
be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material
contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
12.
Limitation
on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU
CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S.
$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It
also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and
support services.
9.    Applicable Law.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law
applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the
laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the
software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn
off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform
substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
(ii)       Limitation of Liability. In case of
intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability
Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is
liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only
be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material
contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
12.
Limitation
on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU
CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S.
$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It
also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

Data Collection. The software may collect
information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft.
Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products

5.   
Scope of
License. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement
only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other

software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the

contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED

PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the

Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting

anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the

anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It

of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the

Entire
Agreement. This
agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and
support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and

software in any other country, its laws apply.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state
or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may
also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then
the following provisions apply to you:
a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn
off updates for your specific device or software.
c)    Germany and Austria.
(i)        Warranty. The software will perform
substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it.
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose
of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence
11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S.
$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a)
anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It
also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.
