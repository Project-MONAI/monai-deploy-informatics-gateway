# MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway <small>v0.0.0</small>

![NVIDIA](./images/MONAI-logo_color.svg)

## Introduction

INTRO

## Requirements

### Development Requirements

* .NET 5.0

### Runtime Requirements

* Docker 20.10.7 or later


## Services

*MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway* contains the following standard protocols to communicate with your medical devices:

* **DICOM SCP**: C-ECHO, C-STORE
* **DICOM SCU**: C-STORE
* **ACR DSI API**: [The American College of Radiologyâ€™s Data Science Institute API](https://www.acrdsi.org/-/media/DSI/Files/ACR-DSI-Model-API.pdf)
  * **DICOMweb client**: QIDO-RS, WADO-RS, STOW-RS
  * **FHIR client**: GET

### DICOM SCP

The *DICOM SCP Service* accepts standard DICOM C-ECHO and C-STORE commands, which receive DICOM instances for processing. The received instances are stored immediately to the configured temporary storage location (`InformaticsGateway>storage>temporary`) and then uploaded to the [MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-workflow-manager). All DICOM instances are stored on disk as-is using the original transfer syntax described in
the [DICOM Interface](./compliance/dicom.md#dicom-scp) section. The MONAI Deploy application developer must handle any encoding/decoding of the DICOM files within the applications. Please refer to the [MONAI Deploy App SDK](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-app-sdk) for further information.

### DICOM SCU

The *DICOM SCU Service* enables users to export application-generated DICOM results to external DICOM devices. It queries the `Results.Get` API from the [MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-workflow-manager) to retrieve user-generated DICOM results assigned to the `MONAISCU` sink (`InformaticsGateway/dicom/scu/sink`).

> [!Note]
> DICOM instances are sent as-is; no codec conversion is done as part of the SCU process. 
> See the [DICOM Interface SCU](./compliance/dicom.md#dimse-services-scu) section for more information.

### ACR DSI API

The ACR DSI API enables users to trigger inference requests via RESTful calls, utilizing DICOMweb & FHIR to retrieve data specified in the request.  Upon data retrieval, the Informatics Gateway forwards the data to the [MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-workflow-manager) for job scheduling.
