Adds HL7 (MLLP) service to enable triggering of workflow requests using HL7 messages. Breaking changes with how Informatics Gateway handles incoming data and uploading to the storage service. All incoming data are now immediately queued for upload to the storage service instead of saving to the local disk. Therefore, if Informatics Gateway restarts or crashes during upload, any queued or incomplete uploads are lost. In addition, during the Informatics Gateway startup, the payload assembly service removes any payloads containing any pending files. Files that were successfully uploaded to the temporary location (storage>temporary) in the bucket (storage>temporaryBucketName) are then moved to the payload bucket (storage>bucketName) before sending a workflow request. Breaking changes in the storage configuration to allow dynamic key-value pairs. Breaking changes to enable dynamic loading of the storage & the messaging libraries. 0.1.1 GitHub Milestone 0.1.1 User guide updates & minor bug fixes. The MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway upgrades the existing NVIDIA Clara Deploy DICOM Adapter to provide additional features and integrate with the MONAI Deploy platform. DICOM SCP (C-ECHO & C-STORE), SCU (C-STORE) support ACR API with ability to retrieve data via DICOMweb & FHIR Integrates with MinIO as the default storage service for storing received/retrieve data and for sharing among other subsystems in MONAI Deploy platform. Integrates with RabbitMQ as the default messaging broker for exchanging requests among other subsystems. For a complete list of supported features, pleas refer to the User Guide."

    "title": "DICOM Interface | MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway v0.5.2",
    "summary": "DICOM Interface The following reference describes the connectivity capabilities of MONAI Deploy SDK out of the box. Users implementing the MONAI Deploy SDK must update their DICOM Conformance Statement according to the actual capabilities of their application. DICOM SCP The DICOM SCP service implements C-ECHO and C-Store services to interface with other medical devices, such as PACS. It allows users to define multiple AE Titles to enable DICOM communication. It then maps each AE Title to a pipeline. DIMSE Services (SCP) C-STORE: Accepts incoming DICOM objects C-ECHO: Accepts incoming DICOM verification requests SOP Classes (Transfer) and Transfer Syntax Supported The DICOM SCP service accepts any proposed transfer syntaxes and stores any accepted instances, as-is, on disk without any decoding support. Association Policies DICOM Storage SCP accepts associations but does not initiate associations. DICOM Storage SCP accepts up to 1000 (default: 25) simultaneous associations across all configured AE Titles. DICOM Storage SCP accepts associations when storage space usage is less than the configured watermark (default: 75% of the storage partition) and the available storage space is above the configured reserved storage size (default: 5GB of free space). Asynchronous mode is not supported. Instead, all operations are performed synchronously. The Implementation Class UID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.30071.8 and the Implementation Version Name is fo-dicom 4.x.x. An association must be released properly for received instances to be associated with a pipeline. Files received from an aborted association or an interrupted connection are either removed immediately or removed based on a configured timeout value. Security Profiles MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway Storage SCP does not conform to any defined DICOM Security Profiles. Therefore, the product is assumed to be used within a secure environment with a firewall, router protection, VPN, and other network security provisions. Users may configure the DICOM Storage SCP service to check the following DICOM values when determining whether to accept Association Open Requests: Calling (source) AE Title: To accept DICOM instances from known sources. Called (MONAI SCP) AE Title: To accept DICOM instance through configured MONAI AETs. DICOM SCU The DICOM Storage SCU provides the DICOM Storage Service for interfacing with other medical devices such as PACS. It is executed at system startup and exists in a container using a single configurable AE Title. DIMSE Services (SCU) C-STORE: Sends user-generated DICOM results to configured destinations. The DICOM Storage SCU initiates a push of DICOM objects to the Remote DICOM Storage SCP. The system allows multiple remote SCPs to be configured. SOP Classes (Transfer) Supported and Transfer Syntax The DICOM Store SCU service supports all SOP Classes of the Storage Service Class. The DICOM Store SCU service transfers a DICOM object as-is using the stored Transfer Syntax, without the support of compression, decompression, or Transfer Syntax conversion. Association Policies DICOM Storage SCU initiates associations but does not accept associations. DICOM Storage SCU allows two (configurable) SCU instances simultaneously. Asynchronous mode is not supported. All operations are performed synchronously. The Implementation Class UID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.30071.8 and the Implementation Version Name is fo-dicom 4.x.x. Security Profiles Not applicable"

    "summary": "HL7 (Health Level 7) The following reference describes the connectivity capabilities of MONAI Deploy SDK out of the box. Users implementing the MONAI Deploy SDK must update their HL7 Conformance Statement according to the actual capabilities of their application. HL7 MLLP Listener The HL7 listener adheres to the Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) which accepts Health Level 7 messages via TCP/IP connections at port 2575 (default). The Informatics Gateway provides basic syntax validation based on HL7-dotnetcore toolkit. All validated messages are stored regardless of the message types. Communication The Informatics Gateway allows concurrent connections for the HL7 listener and allows multiple messages to be transmitted in a single connection or in a single command. Messages received are immediately assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. Configurations The HL7 listener can be configured in the appsettings.json file. Refer to Configuration for additional details. Acknowledgement Mode The listener supports the acknowledgment mode dictated in the MSH.15 field. If no value is specified, the listener defaults to the configuration option sendAck. Supported Character Sets The HL7 listener supports Unicode UTF8 or any 8-bit character sets."

Microsoft Patent Promise for .NET Libraries and Runtime Components Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates (\"Microsoft\") promise not to assert any .NET Patents against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing Covered Code, as part of either a .NET Runtime or as part of any application designed to run on a .NET Runtime. If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in any claim in a lawsuit alleging direct or contributory patent infringement by any Covered Code, or inducement of patent infringement by any Covered Code, then your rights under this promise will automatically terminate. This promise is not an assurance that (i) any .NET Patents are valid or enforceable, or (ii) Covered Code does not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of any third party. No rights except those expressly stated in this promise are granted, waived, or received by Microsoft, whether by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise. This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you agree as a condition of benefiting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise from any other person in connection with this promise. Definitions: \"Covered Code\" means those Microsoft .NET libraries and runtime components as made available by Microsoft at https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource. \".NET Patents\" are those patent claims, both currently owned by Microsoft and acquired in the future, that are necessarily infringed by Covered Code. .NET Patents do not include any patent claims that are infringed by any Enabling Technology, that are infringed only as a consequence of modification of Covered Code, or that are infringed only by the combination of Covered Code with third party code. \".NET Runtime\" means any compliant implementation in software of (a) all of the required parts of the mandatory provisions of Standard ECMA-335 – Common Language Infrastructure (CLI); and (b) if implemented, any additional functionality in Microsoft's .NET Framework, as described in Microsoft's API documentation on its MSDN website. For example, .NET Runtimes include Microsoft's .NET Framework and those portions of the Mono Project compliant with (a) and (b). \"Enabling Technology\" means underlying or enabling technology that may be used, combined, or distributed in connection with Microsoft's .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes, such as hardware, operating systems, and applications that run on .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes. ---- Nito.AsyncEx (from LICENSE.TXT) ---- The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2014 StephenCleary Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

    "summary": "MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway v0.5.2 Introduction MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway (MIG) handles the first and last step in a clinical data pipeline: the input and output (I/O). MIG uses standard protocols like DICOM and FHIR. It stores studies and resources from the medical record system as payloads. It then notifies the rest of the MONAI Deploy system, specifically the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager, that data is ready to be processed. After inference completes, MIG receives notifications for exporting the results to the proper consumers, usually PACS or viewers for visualization, VNAs for storage, and EHRs (Electronic Healthcare Records). A list of supported protocols and services are available on the MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway Services page. Contributing For guidance on making a contribution, see the contributing guidelines. Community To participate, please join the MONAI Deploy App SDK weekly meetings on the calendar and review the meeting notes. Join the conversation on Twitter @ProjectMONAI or join our Slack channel.

    "summary": "Data Plug-ins Data plug-ins enable manipulation of incoming data before they are saved to the storage service or outgoing data right before they are exported. Using Data Plug-ins The Informatics Gateway allows you to configure data plug-ins in the following services: (DIMSE) MONAI Deploy DICOM Listener: Configure each listening AE Title with zero or more data plug-ins via the CLI or via the Configuration API. (DIMSE) DICOM Export: configure the Plug-inAssemblies with one or more data plug-ins in the ExportRequestEvent. (DICOMWeb) STOW-RS: The Virtual AE endpoints (/dicomweb/vae/...) can be configured similarly to the DICOM listener using the DICOMWeb STOW API. For the default /dicomweb/... endpoints, set zero or more plug-ins under InformaticsGateway>dicomWeb>plug-ins in the appsettings.json configuration file. (DICOMWeb) Export: configure the Plug-inAssemblies with one or more data plug-ins in the ExportRequestEvent. Note When one or more plug-ins are defined, the plug-ins are executed in the order as they are listed. Available Plug-ins The following plug-ins are available: Name Description Fully Qualified Assembly Name DicomDeidentifier A plug-in that de-identifies a set of configurable DICOM tags with random data before DICOM data is exported. Monai.Deploy.InformaticsGateway.PlugIns.RemoteAppExecution.DicomDeidentifier, Monai.Deploy.InformaticsGateway.PlugIns.RemoteAppExecution DicomReidentifier A plug-in to be used together with the DicomDeidentifier plug-in to restore the original DICOM metadata. Monai.Deploy.InformaticsGateway.PlugIns.RemoteAppExecution.DicomReidentifier, Monai.Deploy.InformaticsGateway.PlugIns.RemoteAppExecution Creating a Plug-in To create an input data plug-in, implement the IInputDataPlugin interface and put the dynamic link library (DLL) in the plug-ins/ directories. Similarly, for output data plug-ins, implement the IOutputDataPlugin interface. Refer to the Configuration API page to retrieve available input and output data plug-ins. Database Extensions If a plug-in requires presistent data in the database, extend the DatabaseRegistrationBase class to register your database context and repositories. Refer to the Monai.Deploy.InformaticsGateway.PlugIns.RemoteAppExecution plug-in as a reference. Important The Informatics Gateway requires all plug-ins to extend both the Entity Framework (SQLite) and MongoDB databases. Entity Framework Implement the IDatabaseMigrationManagerForPlugIns interface to register your Entity Framework (EF) database context. A connectionString is provided to the Configure(...) function when you extend the DatabaseRegistrationBase class, allowing you to create your code-first EF database context and generate your migration code using the dotnet ef CLI tool. The following example extends the DatabaseRegistrationBase class to register a new EF database context named RemoteAppExecutionDbContext. In the method, you first register the database context, then register your Migration Manager by implementing the IDatabaseMigrationManagerForPlugIns interface. Lastly, you register your repository for the RemoteAppExecutions table. public class DatabaseRegistrar : DatabaseRegistrationBase { public override IServiceCollection Configure(IServiceCollection services, DatabaseType databaseType, string? connectionString) { Guard.Against.Null(services, nameof(services)); switch (databaseType) { case DatabaseType.EntityFramework: Guard.Against.Null(connectionString, nameof(connectionString)); services.AddDbContext<EntityFramework.RemoteAppExecutionDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlite(connectionString), ServiceLifetime.Transient); services.AddScoped<IDatabaseMigrationManagerForPlugIns, EntityFramework.MigrationManager>(); services.AddScoped(typeof(IRemoteAppExecutionRepository), typeof(EntityFramework.RemoteAppExecutionRepository)); break; ... } return services; } } MongoDB Similar to the Entity Framework section above, for MongoDB you first register your Migration Manager by implementing the IDatabaseMigrationManagerForPlugIns interface and then register your repository for the RemoteAppExecutions collection. public class DatabaseRegistrar : DatabaseRegistrationBase { public override IServiceCollection Configure(IServiceCollection services, DatabaseType databaseType, string? connectionString) { Guard.Against.Null(services, nameof(services)); switch (databaseType) { case DatabaseType.MongoDb: services.AddScoped<IDatabaseMigrationManagerForPlugIns, MongoDb.MigrationManager>(); services.AddScoped(typeof(IRemoteAppExecutionRepository), typeof(MongoDb.RemoteAppExecutionRepository)); break; ... } return services; } } In the MigrationManager, configure the RemoteAppExecutions collection. public class MigrationManager : IDatabaseMigrationManagerForPlugIns { public IHost Migrate(IHost host) { RemoteAppExecutionConfiguration.Configure(); return host; } }"

Logging Informatics Gateway, by default, is configured to writes all logs to the console as well as text files. The behaviors may be changed in the nlog.config file. Logs files are stored in the logs/ directory where the Informatics Gateway executable is stored. To change the location, modify the logDir variable defined in the nlog.config file. Informaitcs Gateway also supports shipping logs to LogStash, ELK using the Network target provided by NLog. To enable this feature, simply set the environment variable LOGSTASH_URL to the TCP endpoint of LogStash. E.g. LOGSTASH_URL=tcp://my-logstash-ip:5000. To use other logging services, refer to NLog Config. Note If the Informatics Gateway is running inside a Docker container, additional configuration may be required to limit the size to prevent logs from filling up storage space.

    "summary": "MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway Services MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway supports the following standard protocols for communicating with medical devices: DICOM SCP: C-ECHO, C-STORE DICOM SCU: C-STORE HL7 Server: An HL7 MLLP listener ACR DSI API: The American College of Radiology�s Data Science Institute API DICOMweb client: QIDO-RS, WADO-RS, STOW-RS FHIR Server: POST FHIR client: GET Note The ACR DSI API uses the DICOMweb client and FHIR client. DICOM SCP The DICOM SCP Service accepts standard DICOM C-ECHO and C-STORE commands, which receive DICOM instances for processing. In addition, the Informatics Gateway groups received DICOM instances by the study or series based on the configuration. Once DICOM instances are grouped, they are assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. Workflow Request With a DICOM SCP triggered workflow request, the data trigger contains the following: DataService: DataService.DIMSE Source: <calling AE Title> Destination: <called AE Title> DICOM SCU The DICOM SCU Service allows users to export application-generated DICOM results to external DICOM devices. It subscribes to the md.export.request.monaiscu events generated by the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager, then exports the data to user-configured DICOM destination(s). Note DICOM instances are sent as-is; no codec conversion is done as part of the SCU process. See the DICOM Interface SCU section for more information. DICOMWeb STOW-RS The DICOMWeb STOW-RS Service allows users to trigger a new workflow request by uploading a DICOM dataset. The entire DICOM dataset is assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. It provides options to trigger a workflow with or without specifying a workflow ID/name. See the DICOMWeb STOW-RS section for more information. Workflow Request With a DICOMWeb STOW-RS triggered workflow request, the data trigger contains the following: DataService: DataService.DicomWeb Source: <caller's IP address> Destination: default or <name of Virtual AE Title> HL7 MLLP Server The HL7 MLLP Server accepts Health Level 7 messages via the MLLP (Minimal Lower Layer Protocol). The received messages are validated and assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. Workflow Request If a workflow request is triggered by an HL7 MLLP Server, the data trigger contains the following: DataService: DataService.HL7 Source: <caller's IP address> Destination: <MIG's IP address> ACR DSI API The ACR DSI API allows users to trigger inference requests via RESTful calls, utilizing DICOMweb and FHIR to retrieve data specified in the request. Upon data retrieval, the Informatics Gateway uploads the data to the shared storage and generates an md.workflow.request event, which notifies the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager for processing. See the Inference API for more information. Workflow Request If a workflow request is triggered by the ACR DSI API, the data trigger contains the following: DataService: DataService.ACR Source: <transaction ID from the ACR request> Destination: <MIG's IP address> DICOMweb Export A DICOMweb export agent can export any user-generated DICOM content to configured DICOM destinations. The agent subscribes to the md.export.request.monaidicomweb events generated by the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager, then exports the data to user-configured DICOMweb destination(s). FHIR Server The FHIR Server accepts FHIR resources as described in the FHIR API section. When data arrives at the service, each resource is packaged into a payload and a workflow request is sent to the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager. Workflow Request With an FHIR Server triggered workflow request, the data trigger contains the following: DataService: DataService.FHIR Source: <caller's IP address> Destination: <MIG's IP address>"

Get-FileHash mig-cli-0.2.0-win-x64.zip # Unzip the CLI Expand-Archive -Path mig-cli-0.2.0-win-x64.zip Informatics Gateway Docker Image Navigate to the monai-deploy-informatics-gateway package page and locate the version to download. # for the latest build docker pull ghcr.io/project-monai/monai-deploy-informatics-gateway:latest # or for a versioned build docker pull ghcr.io/project-monai/monai-deploy-informatics-gateway:0.2.0 Configure Informatics Gateway Use the following commands to initialize the Informatics Gateway and default configuration: mig-cli config init mig-cli config endpoint http://localhost:5000 #skip if running locally mig-cli.exe config init mig-cli.exe config endpoint http://localhost:5000 #skip if running locally Note For MONAI Deploy Express, use http://localhost:5003. The first command extracts the default appsettings.json file into the home directory: Linux: ~/.mig/appsettings.json Windows: C:\\Users\\[username]\\.mig\\appsettings.json This file is mapped into the Docker container and used by the Informatics Gateway when mig-cli is used to launch the application. For a complete reference of the appsettings.json file, refer to the Configuration Schema. The second command passes the endpoint for the Informatics Gateway RESTful API to mig-cli. Note To see available commands, simply execute mig-cli or mig-cli.exe. Refer to CLI for complete reference. Database Configuration The Informatics Gateway supports the following database systems: SQLite (default) MongoDB SQLite (default) SQLite is a lite weight, full-featured SQL database engine and is the default database engine used by the Informatics Gateway. With SQLite, the Informatics Gateway works out of the box without any external database service dependencies or configuration. The default configuration maps the database file mig.db in the /database directory. { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"Type\": \"sqlite\", \"InformaticsGatewayDatabase\": \"Data Source=/database/mig.db\" } } MongoDB For enterprise installations, MongoDB is the recommended database solution. To switch from SQLite to MongoDB, edit the appsettings.json file, and change the ConnectionStrings section to the following with the correct username, password, IP address/hostname, and port. { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"Type\": \"mongodb\", \"InformaticsGatewayDatabase\": \"mongodb://username:password@IP:port\", \"DatabaseOptions\": { \"DatabaseName\": \"InformaticsGateway\", \"retries\": { \"delays\": [ \"750\", \"1201\", \"2500\" ] } } } } Other Database Systems Extending the Informatics Gateway to support other database systems can be done with a few steps. If the database system is supported by Microsoft Entity Framework, then it can be added to the existing project. For other database systems that are not listed in the link above, simply implement the Repository APIs, update the Database Manager to support the new database type and optionally, implement the IDabaseMigrationManager. Authentication Authentication is disabled by default. To enable authentication using OpenID, edit the appsettings.json file and set bypassAuthentication to true: { \"MonaiDeployAuthentication\": { \"bypassAuthentication\": true, \"openId\": { \"realm\": \"{realm}\", \"realmKey\": \"{realm-secret-key}\", \"clientId\": \"{client-id}\", \"audiences\": [ \"{audiences}\" ], \"roleClaimType\": \"{roles}\", ... } Refer to the Authentication Setup Using Keycloak section for additional details. Storage Consideration & Configuration The Informatics Gateway operates on two storage locations. In the first location, the incoming data for data grouping is temporarily stored. In the second location, the Informatics Gateway uploads grouped datasets to final storage shared by other MONAI Deploy sub-systems. Temporary Storage of Incoming Dataset By default, the temporary storage location is set to use Disk and stores any incoming files inside /payloads. This can be modified to user a different location, such as Memory or a different path. To change the temporary storage path, locate the InformaticsGateway>storage>localTemporaryStoragePath property in the appsettings.json file and modify it. Note You will need to calculate the required temporary storage based on the number of studies and the size of each study. Also, consider changing the AE Title timeout if the AE Title needs to wait a long time before assembling and uploading the payload for final storage. Note Before running the Informatics Gateway, adjust the values of watermarkPercent and reserveSpaceGB based on the expected number of studies and size of each study. The suggested value for reserveSpaceGB is 2x to 3x the size of a single study multiplied by the number of configured AE Titles. Storage Service Informatics Gateway includes MinIO as the default storage service provider. To integrate with another storage service provider, please refer to the Data Storage section of the SRS. Download and install MinIO by following the quickstart guide. Once MinIO is installed and configured, modify the storage configuration to enable communication between the Informatics Gateway and MinIO. Locate the storage section of the configuration in appsettings.json: { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"InformaticsGatewayDatabase\": \"Data Source=migdev.db\" }, \"InformaticsGateway\": { \"dicom\": { ... }, \"storage\": { \"localTemporaryStoragePath\": \"/payloads\", # path to store incoming data before uploading to the storage service \"remoteTemporaryStoragePath\": \"/incoming\", # the path on the \"temporaryBucketName\" where the data is uploaded to before payload assembly \"bucketName\": \"monaideploy\", # name of the bucket for storing payloads \"temporaryBucketName\": \"monaideploy\", # name of the bucket for temporarily storing incoming data before payload is assembled \"serviceAssemblyName\": \"Monai.Deploy.Storage.MinIO.MinIoStorageService, Monai.Deploy.Storage.MinIO\", # the fully qualified assembly name for the storage service to use \"watermarkPercent\": 75, # a percentage value that indicates when the system shall stop receiving or downloading data. Disk space is calculated based on the path defined in \"localTemporaryStoragePath\" \"reserveSpaceGB\": 5, # minimum disk space required and reserved for the Informatics Gateway \"settings\": { # settings for the storage library: default to minio \"endpoint\": \"localhost:9000\", # MinIO server IP and port number \"accessKey\": \"admin\", # username/access key \"accessToken\": \"password\", # password/access token \"securedConnection\": false, # enable secured connection to minio? \"region\": \"local\", # storatge region \"createBuckets\": \"monaideploy\" # buckets to be created on startup if not already exists } }, ... } } Note Update the createBuckets configuration if you would like to have the Informatics Gateway create the storage buckets on startup. Otherwise, leave it blank. To create multiple buckets, separate each bucket name with comma. Install the Storage Plug-in As shown above, the default plug-in configured is MinIO and is ready to use. To use other storage plug-in, refer to MONAI Deploy Storage for available plug-ins or bring your own plug-in. To install a new storage plug-in, unzip the files to the plug-ins directory in your home directory: Linux: ~/.mig/plug-ins Windows: C:\\Users\\[username]\\.mig\\plug-ins Note If a plug-in other than MinIO is used, update the storageService parameter in the appsettings.json file. Message broker The Informatics Gateway communicates with other MONAI Deploy components through a message broker. The default messaging service included is provided by RabbitMQ. To integrate with another storage service provider, refer to the Data Storage section of the SRS. To use the default messaging service, download and install RabbitMQ by following the Get Started page. The Informatics Gateway publishes all messages to an exchange under the specified virtual host. Before launching Informatics Gateway, update the appsettings.json file to configure the publisher and subscriber settings. { \"InformaticsGateway\": { \"messaging\": { \"publisherServiceAssemblyName\":\"Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ.RabbitMQMessagePublisherService, Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ\", \"publisherSettings\": { \"endpoint\": \"localhost\", \"username\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\", \"virtualHost\": \"monaideploy\", \"exchange\": \"monaideploy\" }, \"subscriberServiceAssemblyName\":\"Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ.RabbitMQMessageSubscriberService, Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ\", \"subscriberSettings\": { \"endpoint\": \"localhost\", \"username\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\", \"virtualHost\": \"monaideploy\", \"exchange\": \"monaideploy\", \"exportRequestQueue\": \"export_tasks\" } }, } } Install the Messaging Plug-in As shown above, the default plug-in configured is RabbitMQ and is ready to use. To use other plug-in, refer to MONAI Deploy Messaging for available plug-ins. To install a new messaging plug-in, unzip the files to the plug-ins directory in your home directory: Linux: ~/.mig/plug-ins Windows: C:\\Users\\[username]\\.mig\\plug-ins Note If a plug-in other than Rabbit is used, update the publisherServiceAssemblyName and subscriberServiceAssemblyName parameters in the appsettings.json file. Start/Stop Informatics Gateway To start or stop the Informatics Gateway, update the value of the DockerImagePrefix parameter in the appsettings.json file with the repository name of the Docker image (the default value is shown below): { ..., \"Cli\": { \"DockerImagePrefix\": \"ghcr.io/project-monai/monai-deploy-informatics-gateway\" } } Lastly, use one of the following commands to start or stop the Informatics Gateway: mig-cli start mig-cli stop Enable Incoming Associations The next step is to configure the Informatics Gateway to enable receiving of DICOM instances from external DICOM devices. Configure a listening AE Title to receive instances: mig-cli aet add -a BrainAET -grouping 0020,000E, -t 30 The command creates a new listening AE Title with AE Title BrainAET. The listening AE Title will group instances by the Series Instance UID (0020,000E) with a timeout value of 30 seconds. Each listening AE Title may be configured with one or more plug-ins to manipulate incoming DICOM files before saving to the storage service and dispatching a workflow request. To include input data plug-ins, first create your plug-ins by implementing the IInputDataPlugIn interface, then add the -p argument, with the fully qualified type name, to the mig-cli aet add command. For example, the following command adds the MyNamespace.AnonymizePlugIn and MyNamespace.FixSeriesData plug-ins from the MyNamespace.Plugins assembly file. mig-cli aet add -a BrainAET -grouping 0020,000E, -t 30 -p \"MyNamespace.AnonymizePlugIn, MyNamespace.PlugIns\" \"MyNamespace.FixSeriesData, MyNamespace.PlugIns\" Note The -grouping argument is optional, with a default value of 0020,000D. The -t argument is also optional, with a default value of 5 seconds. For a complete reference, refer to the Configuration API. Enable the receiving of DICOM instances from external DICOM devices: mig-cli src add -n PACS-LA -a PACSLA001 --h 20.10.30.55 The above command tells the Informatics Gateway to accept instances from AE Title PACSLA001 at IP 20.10.30.55 and port 104. Note By default, Informatics Gateway blocks all unknown sources. To allow all unknown sources, set the dicom>scp>rejectUnknownSources parameter to false in the appsettings.json file. Warning The Informatics Gateway validates both the source IP address and AE Title when rejectUnknownSources is set to true. When the Informatics Gateway is running in a container and data is coming from the localhost, the IP address may not be the same as the host IP address. In this case, open the log file and locate the association that failed; the log should indicate the correct IP address under Remote host. See Data Plug-ins to configure data plug-ins or create your own data plug-ins. Export Processed Results If exporting via DIMSE is required, add a DICOM destination: mig-cli dst add -a WORKSTATION1 -h 100.200.10.20 -p 104 The command adds a DICOM export destination with AE Title WORKSTATION1 at IP 100.200.10.20 and port 104. Logging See schema page for additional information on logging."
